# Tiramisu  

A classic Italian dessert made with layers of espresso-soaked ladyfingers and a creamy mascarpone filling, topped with cocoa powder.  

## Ingredients  

- 1 cup (240ml) strong brewed espresso, cooled  
- 3 tablespoons coffee liqueur (optional)  
- 3 large egg yolks  
- 1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar  
- 8 ounces (225g) mascarpone cheese, softened  
- 3/4 cup (180ml) heavy cream  
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
- 24 ladyfingers (savoiardi)  
- Unsweetened cocoa powder, for dusting  
- Dark chocolate shavings (optional, for garnish)  

## Instructions  

### 1. Prepare the Coffee Mixture  
- **Step 1:** Brew 1 cup of strong espresso and let it cool to room temperature.  
- **Step 2:** If using, mix in 3 tablespoons of coffee liqueur to enhance the flavor.  
- **Step 3:** Pour the cooled coffee mixture into a shallow dish where you‚Äôll dip the ladyfingers. Set aside.  

### 2. Make the Mascarpone Filling  
- **Step 4:** In a heatproof bowl, whisk together 3 large egg yolks and 1/2 cup of granulated sugar until the mixture is smooth and pale.  
- **Step 5:** Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler method). Whisk continuously for about 5 minutes, or until the mixture thickens and doubles in volume.  
- **Step 6:** Remove the bowl from the heat and let it cool slightly.  
- **Step 7:** Once cooled, whisk in 8 ounces of mascarpone cheese until smooth and well combined.  

### 3. Whip the Cream  
- **Step 8:** In a separate bowl, whip 3/4 cup of heavy cream and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract until soft peaks form.  
- **Step 9:** Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture using a spatula. Mix until smooth and fully combined. Be gentle to maintain the airy texture of the whipped cream.  

### 4. Assemble the Tiramisu  
- **Step 10:** Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture for about 1-2 seconds (do not soak them, or they will become too soggy).  
- **Step 11:** Arrange a layer of dipped ladyfingers in the bottom of a serving dish (preferably 9x9-inch or similar).  
- **Step 12:** Spread half of the mascarpone filling over the ladyfingers, smoothing it out with a spatula.  
- **Step 13:** Repeat the process with another layer of dipped ladyfingers and the remaining mascarpone filling.  

### 5. Chill the Tiramisu  
- **Step 14:** Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours (preferably overnight). This allows the flavors to meld and the dessert to firm up.  

### 6. Serve and Garnish  
- **Step 15:** Before serving, dust the top with unsweetened cocoa powder using a fine mesh sieve.  
- **Step 16:** If desired, garnish with dark chocolate shavings or fresh berries.  
- **Step 17:** Slice and serve chilled.  

## Tips  

- Do not soak the ladyfingers for too long; a quick dip is all they need.  
- For a stronger coffee flavor, use espresso instead of regular brewed coffee.  
- The longer it chills, the better the flavors meld‚Äîovernight is ideal.  
- If you want a non-alcoholic version, simply omit the coffee liqueur.  

## Cooking Time  

- **Prep Time:** 20 minutes  
- **Chill Time:** 4+ hours (preferably overnight)  
- **Total Time:** 4 hours 20 minutes  
- **Servings:** 6-8
