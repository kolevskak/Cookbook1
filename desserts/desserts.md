Chocolate Mousse Recipe
Servings: 4
Prep Time: 15 minutes
Chill Time: 2 hours

Ingredients:
200g (7 oz) dark chocolate (at least 70% cocoa), chopped
2 tbsp unsalted butter
2 tbsp sugar (adjust to taste)
3 large eggs, separated
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1 cup (240ml) heavy cream, cold
A pinch of salt
Instructions:
Melt the Chocolate:

In a heatproof bowl, melt the chopped chocolate and butter over a pot of simmering water (double boiler method). Stir occasionally until smooth. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.
Prepare the Egg Yolks:

In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the sugar and vanilla extract until slightly pale and creamy.
Slowly mix the egg yolk mixture into the melted chocolate until well combined.
Whip the Egg Whites:

In another clean, dry bowl, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until stiff peaks form.
Whip the Cream:

In a separate bowl, whip the cold heavy cream until soft peaks form.
Fold Everything Together:

Gently fold the whipped egg whites into the chocolate mixture in batches, being careful not to deflate the mousse.
Next, fold in the whipped cream until the mixture is smooth and airy.
Chill the Mousse:

Spoon the mousse into serving glasses or ramekins.
Refrigerate for at least 2 hours (or overnight) to set.
Serve & Enjoy:

Garnish with whipped cream, chocolate shavings, or fresh berries before serving.
