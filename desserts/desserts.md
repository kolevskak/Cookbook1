Tiramisu
A classic Italian dessert made with layers of espresso-soaked ladyfingers and a creamy mascarpone filling, topped with cocoa powder.



Ingredients
1 cup (240ml) strong brewed espresso, cooled
3 tablespoons coffee liqueur (optional)
3 large egg yolks
1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar
8 ounces (225g) mascarpone cheese, softened
3/4 cup (180ml) heavy cream
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
24 ladyfingers (savoiardi)
Unsweetened cocoa powder, for dusting
Dark chocolate shavings (optional, for garnish)
Instructions
Prepare the Coffee Mixture:

In a shallow dish, combine the cooled espresso and coffee liqueur (if using). Set aside.
Make the Mascarpone Filling:

In a heatproof bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar.
Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler method) and whisk continuously for about 5 minutes until the mixture thickens.
Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.
Whisk in the mascarpone cheese until smooth.
Whip the Cream:

In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream and vanilla extract until soft peaks form.
Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture.
Assemble the Tiramisu:

Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the espresso mixture and layer them in a dish.
Spread half of the mascarpone filling over the ladyfingers.
Repeat with another layer of dipped ladyfingers and the remaining filling.
Chill & Serve:

Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours (preferably overnight).
Before serving, dust with cocoa powder and garnish with chocolate shavings if desired.
Tips:
Do not soak the ladyfingers too long, or they will become mushy. A quick dip is enough.
For a stronger coffee flavor, use espresso instead of regular brewed coffee.
The longer it chills, the better the flavors meld—overnight is ideal.

Chocolate Mousse
A rich and creamy chocolate dessert that’s light yet indulgent.



Ingredients
200g (7 oz) dark chocolate (at least 70% cocoa), chopped
2 tbsp unsalted butter
2 tbsp sugar (adjust to taste)
3 large eggs, separated
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1 cup (240ml) heavy cream, cold
A pinch of salt
Instructions
Melt the Chocolate:

In a heatproof bowl, melt the chopped chocolate and butter over a pot of simmering water (double boiler method). Stir occasionally until smooth. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.
Prepare the Egg Yolks:

In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the sugar and vanilla extract until slightly pale and creamy.
Slowly mix the egg yolk mixture into the melted chocolate until well combined.
Whip the Egg Whites:

In another clean, dry bowl, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until stiff peaks form.
Whip the Cream:

In a separate bowl, whip the cold heavy cream until soft peaks form.
Fold Everything Together:

Gently fold the whipped egg whites into the chocolate mixture in batches, being careful not to deflate the mousse.
Next, fold in the whipped cream until the mixture is smooth and airy.
Chill the Mousse:

Spoon the mousse into serving glasses or ramekins.
Refrigerate for at least 2 hours (or overnight) to set.
Serve & Enjoy:

Garnish with whipped cream, chocolate shavings, or fresh berries before serving.
Tips:
Use high-quality dark chocolate for the best flavor.
Let the melted chocolate cool slightly before adding the egg yolks to avoid scrambling them.
Be gentle when folding in the egg whites and whipped cream to maintain the mousse's airy texture.
For a more intense flavor, add a teaspoon of instant coffee or espresso powder to the chocolate.
