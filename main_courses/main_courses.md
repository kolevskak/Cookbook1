# Spaghetti Carbonara  

A classic Italian pasta dish made with eggs, cheese, pancetta, and pepper for a rich and creamy texture.  

## Ingredients  

- 200g spaghetti  
- 100g pancetta (or guanciale), diced  
- 2 large eggs  
- 50g Parmesan or Pecorino Romano cheese, grated  
- 1 clove garlic (optional)  
- Freshly ground black pepper  
- Salt  
- 1 tbsp olive oil  

## Instructions  

1. **Cook the Pasta:**  
   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  
   - Cook the spaghetti until al dente according to the package instructions.  
   - Reserve about ½ cup of pasta water before draining.  

2. **Prepare the Sauce:**  
   - In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs and grated cheese.  
   - Season with freshly ground black pepper.  

3. **Cook the Pancetta:**  
   - Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat.  
   - Add diced pancetta and cook until crispy.  
   - (Optional) Add a crushed garlic clove for extra flavor, then remove it before proceeding.  

4. **Combine Everything:**  
   - Reduce the heat to low. Add the drained spaghetti to the pan with pancetta.  
   - Toss well to coat in the rendered fat.  
   - Remove from heat and quickly mix in the egg and cheese mixture, stirring continuously to create a creamy sauce.  
   - Add reserved pasta water gradually if needed to loosen the sauce.  

5. **Serve:**  
   - Plate the pasta and sprinkle with extra cheese and black pepper.  
   - Serve immediately and enjoy!  

## Tips  

- Use **guanciale** instead of pancetta for a more authentic taste.  
- Avoid using cream—traditional carbonara relies on eggs
